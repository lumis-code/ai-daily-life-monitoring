# AI Daily Life Monitoring Platform

An explainable, privacy-first web platform for early risk detection in aging societies.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project explores how artificial intelligence can help detect **early changes in daily life patterns** of older adults.

The system focuses on:
- daily activity
- routine stability
- mobility trends

It compares a person **only with their own past behavior**, not with others.

---

## ❗ What This Project Is NOT

- Not a medical device
- Not a diagnosis system
- Not surveillance

This platform provides **early awareness**, not medical decisions.

## 🇯🇵 Why This Matters (Japan Focus)

Japan is one of the fastest-aging societies in the world.

Early detection of behavioral changes can:
- reduce emergencies
- support independent living
- lower care system overload

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. The system learns what is normal for one person
2. It tracks daily activity over time
3. It detects unusual changes
4. It shows a clear risk level
5. It explains the reason in simple language

Example:
> “Your activity level has decreased over the last 7 days.”

Privacy is a core principle:
- No cameras
- No microphones
- No message content
- Minimal data collection
- Full user control

All results are transparent and explainable.
